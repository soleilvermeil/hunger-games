You are playing a turn-based game, where each player tries to be the last one standing. The game is heavily inspired by Hunger Games.

At the beginning of the game, you can either
- **run towards** the cornucopia, which may grant you a weapon, but where you may also get killed;
- **run away** from the cornucopia, which leaves you with no weapon, but you also have higher chances of survival.

At all other turns, you can either
- **hunt** for players. If you manage to kill someone, you gain all of their items, food and weapon. You also gain a lot of hype. While hunting, you are also less vulnerable to attacks.
- **gather** resources. You might find food or water, but in exchange you are more vulnerable to attacks. If you are at the cornucopia, you may also find deadly weapons.
- **rest**, where you restore energy, but might get killed instantly if attacked.
- **hide**, where you cannot be attacked, but you lose a lot of hype.

Hunting and gathering have more chance of success during day, while resting is more efficient during night.

When your hype is high enough, you might receive food, water, weapons and, most importantly, medecine. Note that this is the only way a character can heal.
